# Radio Galaxy classification

The goal of this project is to develop a python package for classifying different morphological types of radio Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using artificial neural networks (ANN) and maintain the package through regular upgrades. The package is called RGC after Radha Gobinda Chandra (1878-1975), a Bangladeshi-Indian amateur astronomer who contributed more than fifty thousand observations to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (Maitra 2021) and reported the observation of Halleyâ€™s Comet in 1910 in Bangla (Kapoor 2023).
